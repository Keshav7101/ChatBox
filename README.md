# Chatbox
A chat bot application
# Problem Statement
## What do we want to create?
### 1.1 A desktop Application
We want to create a conversational chatbot using Java which will be a web application. This Application will be a funny, conversational chatbot with a little inbuilt game that will be launching with the response of the user that he/she wants to play a game.

## What is our idea about?
### 2.1 Problem Statement
It is evident from the research carried out in the literature review that modern technologies most widely uses artificial intelligence. All the cell phones and computers nowadays have artificial intelligence application built in them some of the examples are Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri, and Cortana.
These applications are being widely used by users on their devices for fun and entertainment; here, we are trying to implement a small part of those applications.
Artificial intelligence chatbot is a technology that makes interactions between man and machines using natural language possible.
Chatbots are software agents that interact with the user in a conversation. The main goal of their creation was to resemble a human being in the way they perform said interaction, trying to make the user think he/she is writing to another human being.
The chatbot will allow users to feel confident and comfortable when using this service regardless of the userâ€™s computer literacy due to the natural language used in messages. It also provides a very accessible and efficient service as all interactions will take place within the one chat conversation negating the need for the user to navigate through a site.
             
### 2.2 Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is to create a chatbot to simulate a human conversation to assist users with their conversation needs and to provide a more personal experience. Advancements in artificial intelligence, improved aptitude for decision making, broader availability of domains and corpus, have increased the practicality of integrating a chatbot into applications.
Users will be able to ask any queries in natural language that they are comfortable using such as; tell my name, tell time, simple fun chat. The chatbot will identify and understand what the user is asking and generate an appropriate response based on the conversational context. Immediate responses will be provided by the chatbot to follow the conversation quickly and to chat further.
